# CUDA Practice — Daily Progress Log

This repository contains small CUDA / GPU exercise implementations and notes. Below is a concise day-by-day summary of what I worked on.

## Daily log

- 2025-05-17
  - Day 1: Added a basic vector addition kernel and project scaffolding to get started with CUDA development.

- 2025-12-02
  - 2D Vecotr Addition kernel, read PMPP Ch. 1, notes can be found inside pmpp_notes folder, CS149 Lecture1.

- 2025-12-03
  - Implemented a 3D vector addition kernel, read PMPP Ch. 2, CUDA C Programming model, GPU_MODE Session 1 about using custom Cuda kernels using load_inline module from Pytorch.

- 2025-12-04
  - Implemented an rgb_to_grayscale kernel, using inline load helpers from PyTorch for convenient tensor access.
  - Implemented a mean_kernel for an image blur effect and addressed memory-layout differences between the mean (blur) kernel and the grayscale kernel.
  - PMPP CH. 3, GPU_MODE Session 2, 3.

- 2025-12-05
  - Implemented matrix multiplication as part of exercise 3.1 (PMPP) and compared execution times of element-wise kernel, row-wise and column-wise kernel with cpu execution times.
  - PMPP CH. 4 (ongoing), GPU_MODE Session 4.
